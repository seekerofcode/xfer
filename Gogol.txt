It is said that in England a fish put its head out of water 
and said a word or two in such an extraordinary language 
that learned men have been puzzling over them for three years, 
and have not succeeded in interpreting them yet. 
I also read in the paper of two cows who entered a shop and asked for a pound of tea.

How could such a foolish idea enter my head? 
It was fortunate that it occurred to no one to shut me up in an asylum. 
Now it is all clear, and as plain as a pikestaff. 
Formerly -- I don't know why -- everything seemed veiled in a kind of mist. 
That is, I believe, because people think that the human brain is in the head. 
Nothing of the sort; it is carried by the wind from the Caspian Sea.

But I feel much annoyed by an event which is about to take place tomorrow; 
at seven o'clock the earth is going to sit on the moon. 
This is foretold by the famous English chemist, Wellington.
