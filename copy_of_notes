copied from assignment write up:

""""
states: INIT, SENT_OK
INIT:	thread is waiting to get XFER from client
	data: XFER <filename> <flen> string
SENT_OK: data: bytes of the file
if error: break out of loop, which closes sock

Put \n after every sendall() string sent, except when sending file bytes
"""



what are the states (INIT, SENT_OK) for?
why put \n after every sendall()?
does using * on the command line have to work?

I didn't use `if not data:` because I think it kept getting stuck on sock.recv(1024)
I don't have to cover all bases on command line args right? Is it enough to just check number of args and make sure the files exist?
